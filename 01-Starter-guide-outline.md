### REQUIREMENTS

This section should describe what a developer needs to be both familiar with and what is required, including OS, programming languages, supported browsers and their versions, plus server requirements. Note: Before a developer can use an api, the api must be registered, which is the first step under usage below.

### USAGE

This section provides the basic getting-started instructions per the following subtopics:

#### Registering Your Application

This section instructs the developer on how to register their application, including getting api keys and client secret values, or provides a link to a separate _"Registering Your Application"_ section.

#### Adding APIs to the Project

This section describes how to add a file to a html document, or create a script. This section should also contain instructions on how to add the api to a project along with code example(s).

#### Initializing the API

This section describes how to add the API key and/or the client key, providing code example(s), plus possibly success and failure cases.

#### Making HTTP Requests

This section describes how a developer communicates with the server in terms of requests, creation, modifications, and deleting data with common REST verbs: **GET**, **POST**, **UPDATE** and **DELETE**.

Also, this section possibly provides illustrations with code examples.

### RESOURCES

This section lists other resources/documents that provide more details on the API, including **github repo**, **developer portal**, **blog**, and **support pages**. It might also point to a **forum** if available.
