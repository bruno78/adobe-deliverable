## CRUD/REST API Getting Starter Guide Outline

### Introduction

A brief the description the api explaining its purpose and if it's the case, why it's required.

It also should contain a contents' list for orientation and faster access.

### Contents

* [Contents](#contents)
* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [Usage](#usage)
  * [How to Register Your Application](#how-to-register-your-application)
  * [Adding The API to The Project](#adding-the-api-to-the-project)
  * [Initializing The API](#initializing-the-api)
  * [Making Requests (HTTP)](#making-requests-http)
* [Resources](#resources)

### Requirements

Before developers can use the api, it should mention that they must register it.
The requirements should describe what the developer should be familiar with, along with OS, programming languages, supported browsers and their versions, and server requirements.

### Usage

Instructions on how to get started with the api with a set of subtopics as it follows:

#### Registering Your Application

This part should either instruct the developers on how to register their application and get api key and client secret values, or a link to _"Registering Your Application"_ section.

#### Adding The API to The Project

Either adding a file to a html document, or creating script. This section should contain instructions on how to add the api to project along with some code example(s).

#### Initializing The API

Show to add the API key and/or the client key with code example(s) and possibly what are the success and failure cases.

#### Making Requests (HTTP)

Since dealing with CRUD/REST api, it's necessary to demonstrate how developers can communicate with server when comes to request, create, modify, and delete data with common REST verbs: **GET**, **POST**, **UPDATE** and **DELETE**.

Possibly illustrate with code examples.

Pointers to a more detailed documentation, github repo and support pages. It might also points to a forum if available.
