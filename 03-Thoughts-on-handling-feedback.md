# 3. Thoughts on handling developer feedback in a public forum
--------------------------------------------------------------

### i. We did a quick gut check, and no APIs seem to be down. No other developers are reporting similar issues.

First, I'd empathize with the developer with _"I'm sorry to hear you're having problems..."_ and then say that we checked the api and seems to be working fine. So I'd ask her/him to send me a direct message and to be more specific on what kind of issues the developer is going thru to make sure if it is anything that is either a common issue or can be found at support page, possibly showing the code snippet and try to work out with her/him.


#### ii. We did a gut check, and yikes: a certain set of APIs are down. Similar tweets are starting to flow in.

In cases like this, I'd issue a message acknowledging the issue, stating that we are working hard to get it back in order as soon as we can, and then apologize for the inconvenience. Also attaching the proper hashtags related to the issue. Once the problem is fixed, communicate via twitter and/or other social media, and forums that the api is back, up and running.
