# CC Developer Experience: Community Engineer

_Take-home challenge_

### Overview


The Community Engineer will contribute to the Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Experience team, helping drive our
online community engagement with developers.
The nature of our engagement efforts will take shape and evolve over time, but will surely include developer-focused blog content, email outreach to developers, interaction with and monitoring of online forums such as Stackoverflow, co-
creation of resources such as developer guides and sample apps, and more. Tracking and optimizing for relevant metrics related to our engagement activities will be critical.

The deliverables for this take-home challenge will give you a chance to explore our developer offerings as they are
today, and demonstrate your skills and experience in some of the areas this role will touch upon.
