# 4. Existing Examples
----------------------

### Overview:

For the past two years, I had the opportunity to work on two major projects which are two websites that I built from the ground up, also, I've joined the NYC.JS.ORG group where I'm one of the organizers for the Angular-NYC, and VueNYC.

Lately, I'm responsible for  I created my own group Creative Coding NYC together with other two colleagues with the goal:
 > _"brings together makers from various backgrounds to share and talk about creative coding. Whether a project solves daily problems, evokes discussion, or is simply a personal expression; creative coding inspires programmers and tinkerers to get inventive."_

We hold monthly meetings.
