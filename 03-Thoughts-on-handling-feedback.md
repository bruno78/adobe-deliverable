# 3. Thoughts on handling developer feedback in a public forum


### i. We did a quick gut check, and no APIs seem to be down. No other developers are reporting similar issues.

First, I would empathize with the developer, saying, _"I'm sorry to hear you're having problems..."_ and then I would say that we have checked the api and everything seems to be working fine. I would ask her/him to send me a direct message with more specific information on exactly what kind of issue they're having, and possibly ask for a code snippet. I would then try to determine if it is anything that is a common issue or can be found on support pages, trying to work things out with her/him after that, either resolving things myself or forwarding to somebody on the team who might be more qualified.


#### ii. We did a quick gut check, and yikes: a certain set of APIs are down. Similar tweets are starting to flow in.

In cases like this, I would start again with the same empathy phrase as above, then acknowledge the issue, stating that we are currently working hard to get things back in order as soon as we can, apologizing again for the inconvenience. I would also be sure to attach the proper hashtags related to the issue. Once the problem is fixed, I would then communicate via twitter and/or other social media, and forums, letting everyone know the api is fully operational again, back up and running smoothly. Lastly, I would keep an eye on social media to make sure there are no continuing issues.
