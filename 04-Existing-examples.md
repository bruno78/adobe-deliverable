# 4. Existing Examples


### Overview:

I've been studying coding for two years. I started providing freelance developer services about a year ago, and have since worked on two major rebranding website projects: one for a [bar](http://therosemontnyc.com) in Brooklyn, including [customized features](http://brunogtavares.com/2017/02/10/the-rosemontnyc-process.html) for owner updates; and another for Art_Bridge Architecture, a multidisciplinary design firm, with newsletter and social network pages. Shortly after creating the Art_Bridge page on Architizer, they featured one of the firm's [projects](https://architizer.com/projects/lo-residence/). I also recently launched phase two of Art_Bridge's [website](http://www.artbridgearchitecture.com), including elaborated project pages with written descriptions, photos and drawings.

About six months ago, I joined the NYC.JS.ORG group, where I am now one of the organizers for [Angular-NYC](https://www.meetup.com/angularnyc) and [VueNYC](https://www.meetup.com/vueJsNYC).

About three months ago, I started [Creative Coding NYC](https://www.meetup.com/Creative-Coding-NYC) with two colleagues. We present monthly events. The group's goal is as follow:
 > _"Creative Coding NYC brings together makers from various backgrounds to share and talk about creative coding. Whether a project solves daily problems, evokes discussion, or is simply a personal expression, creative coding inspires programmers and tinkerers to get inventive."_
